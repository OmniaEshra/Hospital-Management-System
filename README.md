# Hospital-Management-System
This is a simple hospital management system developed as a learning project using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, PHP, and SQL. The system is designed to manage basic administrative tasks and operations within a healthcare facility, including patient management, billing, appointment scheduling, electronic health records, and inventory management.

## Technologies Used
HTML
CSS
JavaScript
jQuery
PHP
SQL

## Features
Patient management: add, view, edit, and delete patient records
Billing: generate bills, track payments, and view payment history
Appointment scheduling: schedule and manage appointments for patients and doctors
Electronic health records: store and retrieve patient health records
Inventory management: track and manage medical supplies and equipment

The system facilitates the registration needs as it records all the information related to the patient and creates his own medical record to make it easier for all departments in the hospital to know the required data without the need to register the patient's data again. This system will reduce routine operations and technical errors and will contribute to saving money and time as well.

## Getting Started
To run the system, you will need a web server with PHP and SQL support. You can use XAMPP or WAMP to set up a local development environment.

#### Clone this repository to your local machine.
``` 
Import the hospital.sql file into your SQL database.
Update the database credentials in config.php to match your database configuration.
Start your web server and navigate to index.php to access the system.

```
